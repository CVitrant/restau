# restau
Making a website for a fake restaurant for our web dev and mobile dev course.
Using bootstrap as much as possible to make the website responsive, creating a home page, a gallery page, a contact page, an about us page and our services page.
Coded by Clément Vitrant, Florian Verin and Lucas Sémérano.
This website is not meant to be online, it was meant to be an exercise to train our knowledge on bootstrap, HTML and CSS.
